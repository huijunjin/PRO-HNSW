# PRO-HNSW: Proactive Repair and Optimization for High-Performance Dynamic HNSW Indexes

This repository contains the source code and experimental artifacts for our paper. 

Our experiments were conducted on python version of **3.11.7**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Setup

Please follow these steps in a terminal to set up the project.

### 1. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
